# HANDOFF — SafarSathi — 2026-09-12 (after issue #6)

> Overwrite this file at the end of every session. It must let a cold model
> (any model) resume in under 2 minutes.

## Where we are

- **Issues #1 to #6 are done except for the device check.** The project
  analyses clean and passes **74 tests** in about three seconds on
  Flutter 3.47.3 / Dart 3.13.3. It has never run on a phone.
- Backlog position: 6 / 52 done. Next is **#7, copy / dialer / call / chat** —
  the actions the diary already has a seam for.
- **The diary screen exists and renders.** A debug-only demo trip is seeded
  when the database has no trip, so `flutter run` shows something.
- The database has 16 tables and 27 foreign keys, all asserted by tests that
  query `sqlite_master` rather than trusting generated code.
- Design is complete and prototyped: eleven screens, both themes, full
  decision log.

## Prototypes

- Screens, eleven, live: https://claude.ai/code/artifact/548c02bc-d0ef-439d-abbc-7a5909a95d14
- Visual system: https://claude.ai/code/artifact/0d81dd67-d217-4056-81b3-33e0bb889e95

Contact numbers in them are illustrative placeholders. The helplines are the
real Tier-1 codes with their government sources.

## What is verified, and what is not

| Checked | How |
|---|---|
| Compiles, analyses clean | `flutter analyze` — no issues |
| Palette contrast, both themes, both grounds | test, WCAG ratios computed |
| Tabular figures on every numeric style | test |
| The `wght` axis pinned on every style | test |
| No drop shadow in either theme | test |
| Layout at 400×800 and in night palette | widget test, no exceptions |
| All 16 tables exist | test against `sqlite_master` |
| Foreign keys on, cascades work | test — deletes a trip, checks orphans |
| No contact can arrive confirmed | test |
| Double-seeding a helpline is rejected | test — makes #4 idempotent |
| POI is stop XOR leg | test — both-null and both-set rejected |
| A 3-way split of ₹3,200.11 loses nothing | test |
| Seeding twice changes nothing, ids intact | test |
| 1930, 1078, 1033, 104 never reach the DB | test |
| Every seeded number carries a source | test |
| The state helpline list ships empty | test |
| Diary ordering: pinned, confirmed, alphabetical | test |
| Filters compose; stop scope keeps trip-wide | test |
| **Import cannot produce a confirmed contact** | test |
| A failed batch leaves nothing behind | test |
| A copy is logged like any other action | test |
| The trust dot renders on untrusted tiers only | widget test, both themes |
| Diary margin numbers, page footer, empty states | widget test |
| Search, thumb index, stop-scope toggle | widget test |
| The screen fits 400×800 in both themes | widget test |

**Not verified, and not verifiable without a phone:**

- **Whether the fonts actually load.** The widget test harness substitutes its
  own font, so no automated check will ever catch a family-name mismatch.
  If the stencil labels do not look condensed on device, `pubspec.yaml` and
  `app_tokens.dart` disagree.
- Whether the haptics fire.
- Whether the night palette is pleasant at 2am, as opposed to merely passing.
- Whether the grain reads as texture or as dirt.

## Testing rules learned at #6 — do not relearn these

1. **A widget test cannot close a Drift database.** `close()` awaits work the
   fake clock never advances; the test hangs until the runner is killed, with
   no error and no timeout.
2. **Cancelling a Drift query stream schedules zero-duration cleanup timers**
   during disposal, and the pending-timer check runs after user teardowns, so
   pumping in `addTearDown` cannot clear them.
3. **`pumpAndSettle` never settles** on a screen whose loading state is a
   `CircularProgressIndicator`.
4. A filter change swaps in a new stream that delivers on a microtask, so an
   interaction needs **two** pumps.

The answer to all of it: **screens take streams, not DAOs.** Widget tests use
in-memory fakes with no database. Keep it that way.

Also: `pkill -f "flutter test"` matches the shell running the command and
kills it, which looks exactly like a crash.

## What issue #5 found

**The drafted `insertBatch` could import a confirmed contact.** It passed the
caller's companion straight through, so a screen building a verified row would
have landed it verified — and the readiness check, the amber dot and the
blocking checklist items all read that flag. Now forced in the DAO, which is
the single write surface. A test proves the hole exists without the guard.

Also: the drafted ordering comment claimed recency the code never did, and
should not — `lastCalledAt` is null for never-called contacts, so ordering by
it would sink exactly the numbers the readiness system wants surfaced.

## What issue #2 found

**Code generation silently produced a schema with no foreign keys at all.**
At `drift_dev` 2.31 under `analyzer` 10, every `references(...)` was
discarded; `build_runner` reported success and wrote 20 outputs, with only a
vague warning about a class name scrolling past. Upgrading drift to 2.35
fixed it, which cascaded into bumping `drift_flutter` and
`sqlite3_flutter_libs`.

The tests now assert against `sqlite_master`, not against generated Dart.
Reading a generator's output to check the generator is circular.

## What the first compile found

Each of these was silent and would have cost a session later:

1. **The repo root `.gitignore` is a Python one; its `lib/` rule swallowed the
   whole Dart source tree.** The first commit reported success and contained
   no code. Fixed with `!lib/` at the top of `safarsathi/.gitignore` — there
   is a comment there saying not to remove it.
2. **Google Fonts no longer ships static instances** of Inter or Archivo
   Narrow. Both are bundled as variable fonts; every style pins `wght` via
   `FontVariation` or the app renders at one weight with no warning.
3. **`muted` failed AA.** `#6B7670` measures 4.41:1 on paper and 3.94:1 on
   stone against a documented 4.9:1 — the design doc's arithmetic was wrong.
   Now `#5F6963`, asserted by test on both grounds.
4. Two `clamp` calls returning `num` where `double` was required, and a
   `CustomPaint` with an infinite size. Caught by reading, before the SDK
   finished downloading.
5. The 8-bit grain tile was 15 KB against a 4 KB budget; 2-bit is 3.2 KB.

## Next action (this line starts the next session)

**Write `docs/ISSUE_7_Actions.md`, then do backlog #7.** The diary already
exposes `onCopy` and `onOpen` and passes them nowhere — wire them in
`app.dart`:

- Tap copies `phoneE164 ?? phoneRaw` to the clipboard (`flutter/services`,
  no package needed), fires a light haptic, and logs `copy` to CallLogs.
- A toast above the nav area holds the number and an `OPEN DIALER` button
  that launches the platform dialer with an empty field.
- `tel:`, `sms:` and `wa.me` as explicit secondary actions via
  `url_launcher`, each logged.
- Handle the no-app-available case gracefully.

**Verify on a real device that `tel:` with no path opens the Android dialer
rather than erroring.** If it does error, fall back to `ACTION_DIAL` over a
platform channel and log a decision about it.

Then #8 (add/edit entry) and #9 (the confirm stamp).

Before any of it, run `flutter run` on the phone and settle the unverified
items above. If the fonts are wrong, fix that first — everything after is
built on it.

## Note on the environment

Flutter is **not** installed in a fresh container. Getting it took a 1.5 GB
download. If a future session needs to compile, budget for that or work on a
machine that already has it.

## Open questions / waiting on Yash

1. **Project name.** "SafarSathi" is still a placeholder.
2. **Dedicated repo.** `docs/safarsathi/` and `safarsathi/` are parked in
   `yash0304/ml` and move together.
3. **Map tile provider.** MapTiler or Stadia. Needed before #24.
4. **Trip target.** Meghalaya is 1–5 October. Contacts-only v0.1 is plausible;
   the offline sync milestone is not.
5. **Archivo Narrow** — look at it on the phone. It is the one purely
   aesthetic choice in the system.
6. **`tel:` with an empty path** — confirm it opens the Android dialer.
   Fallback is `ACTION_DIAL` over a platform channel.
7. **Thumb index overflow.** Eleven categories do not fit a phone edge.
8. **Checklist regeneration** must not discard manual edits. The
   `isUserEdited` column exists for this; the rule is decided at #29.
9. **`sqlite3_flutter_libs` resolves to `0.6.0+eol`.** The `+eol` marker
   suggests the package is being retired, probably folded into `sqlite3`.
   Worth ten minutes reading its changelog before the build depends on it
   for a year. Not urgent — it works, and it is what `drift_flutter` 0.3.1
   requires.
